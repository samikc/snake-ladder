# An Automated Snake-Ladder Board Game 

This is an automated snake-ladder board game. The game is played automatically between two players.

This is done as part of my Scala learning effort. This may grow in future as I learn new Scala features.

# How to run?

The source is written and compiled with Scala version 2.11.8.

Run the SnakeLadder after you have compiled.
